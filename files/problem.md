# Problem Background

## Problem Background
Chronic pain management is a critical area of healthcare, where understanding the dynamics of patient-reported outcomes can significantly improve treatment planning and outcomes. However, collecting detailed, accurate data from patients is often time-intensive, costly, and challenging. Developing simulations and predictive models can help bridge this gap by creating synthetic datasets and improving forecasting methods, making it possible to optimize care without overburdening patients.

This hackathon focuses on designing and testing innovative approaches to simulate and predict pain dynamics, incorporating real-world challenges such as treatment effects, variability in symptoms, and the constraints of sampling frequency. These tasks have practical relevance for building tools that support personalized care and decision-making in chronic pain management.

Below are the two tasks for the hackathon:


## Task 1 Description: Simulation with Treatment Dynamics

### Task Overview
In this challenge, you’ll build a simulation that generates daily pain measurements for a set of patients over a certain period. Unlike a standard static dataset, this simulation should capture treatment effects and day-to-day fluctuations in patient pain levels. The end goal is to produce a realistic synthetic dataset that can be used in subsequent modeling tasks.

More details will be provided during the hackathon.

[//]: # (### The Data)

[//]: # (Each simulated patient record should contain:)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (1. Patient ID: A unique identifier for each patient &#40;e.g., 1 through 1,000&#41;.)

[//]: # (2. Days &#40;1 to 180&#41;: A 180-day timeline for each patient.)

[//]: # (3. Pain Measurements &#40;0–10 scale&#41;: Daily pain scores. You may incorporate:)

[//]: # (- Baseline pain levels,)

[//]: # (- Potential improvement or worsening over time,)

[//]: # (- Random noise or variability,)

[//]: # (- Simple or complex “treatment effect” curves &#40;e.g., medication starts, dosage changes, tapering, etc.&#41;.)

### The Challenge


#### Design a Simulation:

- Introduce treatment dynamics—for example, a medication might reduce pain after 2 weeks, then fade in effectiveness over the next month.
- Ensure each patient’s trajectory looks diverse yet realistic (no single pattern for all).

#### Incorporate Variability: 
- Account for the natural history of disease over time, including phases of improving strove and worsening symptoms, as well as short-term effects that may change gradually or more rapidly. Superimpose treatments and their corresponding responses. Finally, include random fluctuations to represent day-to-day changes.


### Evaluation
The result of your simulation will be evaluated by the domain experts. While there is no explicit “forecasting score,” the simulation should meet the following criteria:

1. Maintain Realism: Ensure pain levels remain logical patterns (e.g., steady improvement or clinically reasonable oscillations).
2. Facilitate Future Tasks: The resulting dataset should be suitable for subsequent analysis tasks.

You are encouraged to be creative in modeling elements with different parameters to enhance the simulator. The ultimate goal is to produce a coherent, flexible simulator that generates daily pain measurements influenced by mock treatments over a certain time period.

## Task 2 Description: Predicting Pain Measurements and Optimizing Sampling Frequency

### Task Overview
Imagine you have data on a number of patients, each with daily pain measurements recorded over a certain time period. However, in the real world, collecting patient-reported outcomes can be demanding and time-consuming. Your mission is to forecast patients’ pain measurement with high accuracy—while also minimizing the number of data points you request.

More details will be provided during the hackathon.

[//]: # (### The Data)

[//]: # (1. Training Set: Full 180-day pain trajectories for 800 patients. Use these to build and fine-tune your models.)

[//]: # (2. Test Set &#40;For result evaluation&#41;: 200 patients, for which you’ll initially see only the first 30 days of data.)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (### The Twist: Adaptive Data Retrieval)

[//]: # (Before generating your final predictions on days 151–180, you have the option to retrieve additional daily measurements from days 30–150 for each patient—but at a cost. Each requested data point adds to your overall penalty.)


### The Challenge
- You receive a training set consisting of fully observed patient records.
- For a separate test set of patients, you can strategically choose to request—or skip—daily measurements from the partially observed portion of their records.
- Finally, you must forecast pain levels for the remainder of the timeline, using the measurements you’ve gathered along with any initial data provided.

[//]: # (### Evaluation)

[//]: # (You will be scored on two factors:)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (1. Predictive Accuracy: How close your forecasts are to the true pain values &#40;e.g., via Mean Absolute Error&#41;.)

[//]: # (2. Data Cost: The number of extra data points you requested.)

[//]: # (We’ll combine these into a single score, penalizing overuse of data queries. Low error with minimal requests = the best score!)
