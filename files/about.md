## Who should apply?

We aim to recruit 30 participants for an in-person session. The participants will include:

1. Early career researchers (e.g., PhD students, postdoctoral researchers) specializing in health data research, and
2. Health data scientists with a focus on research in healthcare or related fields.


## How much will it cost me to attend?

Participants will be required to arrange their own transport and accommodation. A limited number of bursaries maybe available.

## Cancellations

If circumstances beyond our control lead to an event cancellation for any reason, any registration fees will be refunded. However, participants should ensure they take out adequate personal insurance for any pre-booked travel as it is not possible for HRfH to refund any incurred costs if a cancellation occurs.
