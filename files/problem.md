# Problem Background

## Introduction

<span style="color:red">TODO: Intro for HRfH</span>

[Proteins](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26911/) are the workhorses of the cell. They are the building blocks of cellular infrastructure, they regulate gene expression, control the cell cycle, transport molecules, transduce signals, trigger immune responses, and catalyze essential biochemical reactions. The ability of proteins to take on such a staggering diversity of functions is critical to life’s survival. It is also the reason proteins are used in such a wide range of industrial and therapeutic applications.

A protein’s function is encoded in its amino acid sequence, a molecular word constructed from an alphabet of twenty letters. Genetic changes, such as DNA mutations, that alter a protein’s amino acid sequence can impact its function. Such changes can be beneficial to an organism, such as those that increase protein thermostability, which can provide an adaptive advantage in a warming world. Others are beneficial for industrial and therapeutic applications, such as those that increase the catalytic efficiency of an enzymatic reaction, which can enhance biofuel production, or those that confer cellular specificity to an antibody, which can improve the efficacy of immunotherapeutics. Others still are flat-out detrimental, leading to developmental disorders, disease, or death. Understanding how mutations influence protein function is therefore important in many scientific disciplines, including evolutionary biology, protein engineering, and drug design.

## Adaptive Sampling Frequency

<span style="color:red">TODO: Need to update</span>

- Researchers want to collect high-quality data frequently (eg daily)
- Patients and the public, however, will tire of regular data collection, especially if symptoms controlled


## The Task

<span style="color:red">TODO: Need to update</span>

- Groups provided with dataset(s) of tracked daily symptoms from long-term conditions that have periods of flare or exacerbation (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, COPD, schizophrenia)
- Need to develop an adaptive sampling frequency algorithm that adapts the frequency of submission to reduce at times of stability and increase at times of change
