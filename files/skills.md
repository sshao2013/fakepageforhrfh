# Skills you will need

This hackathon will involve demonstration programs and code samples in [R](https://www.r-project.org/), [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/). To make the most of the event, participants should familiarize themselves with these technologies in advance. We recommend exploring the following freely available resources:

- [R Tutorials](https://open.ed.ac.uk/r-tutorials/)
- [The Hitchhikers Guide to Python](https://docs.python-guide.org/intro/learning/)
- [Learn PyTorch for Deep Learning: Zero to Mastery book](https://www.learnpytorch.io/)
- [PyTorch Tutorials](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/)

During the 3-day hackathon, you will also have access to clinicians and patients, providing valuable real-world insights to help validate and refine your work. Clear communication skills will be essential for explaining your findings and presenting your final results.
