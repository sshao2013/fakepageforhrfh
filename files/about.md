## How much will it cost me to attend?

Thanks to sponsorship by Roche and support from Health Data Research UK, we are able to offer the event with no registration fee. However, participants will be required to arrange their own transport and accommodation unless otherwise with HDRUK. A limited number of bursaries maybe available.

## Cancellations

If circumstances beyond our control lead to an event cancellation for any reason, any registration fees will be refunded. However, participants should ensure they take out adequate personal insurance for any pre-booked travel as it is not possible for HDRUK to refund any incurred costs if a cancellation occurs.
