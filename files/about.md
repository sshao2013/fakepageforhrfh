# About the Hackathon

## What is the purpose of the Hackathon?

- Build a collaborative community of early career researchers with interests in biostats/ data science/ AI
- Introduce this community to wider HRfH stakeholders â€“ patients, clinicians, other HRfH researchers
- Tackle difficult and important challenges in HRfH time series data
- Generate reusable code
- During the three days, you will work in small groups to address two challenges in the area of tracked daily symptoms for people living with long-term conditions.

## Who should apply?

We aim to recruit 20 participants for an in-person session. The participants will include:

Early career researchers (e.g., PhD students, postdoctoral researchers) from academic or industrial background specializing in health data research.



## How much will it cost me to attend?

There is no cost to participate, however, the participants will be required to pay for and arrange their own transport and accommodation. A limited number of bursaries maybe available.

## Cancellations

The participants should ensure they take out adequate personal insurance for any pre-booked travel as it is not possible for HRfH to refund any incurred costs if an unavoidable cancellation occurs.
